### Data can be downloaded from [https://github.com/ipavlopoulos/toxic_spans/tree/master/data](https://github.com/ipavlopoulos/toxic_spans/tree/master/data).

In our code, we are directly accessing the data from the repository, so we have not placed it in our own data folder. We are primarily using below two files:

- tsd_train.csv -> Toxic spans train set
- tsd_test.csv -> Toxic spans test set
